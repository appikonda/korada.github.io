	<p>I was reading through the articles today and seen facebook bought instagram. Reading the headline my first word was &#8220;NOOOO&#8221;.</p><p>What really puzzles me is, did facebook buy instagram for it&#8217;s user base or to incorporate those features in their website/app?</p><p>Whatever, those very few employees of instagram are rich now. Hope Facebook doesn&#8217;t ruin that app with its ads and other stuff.. I like this app the way it is now..</p>
