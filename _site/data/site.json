&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I was scheduled to take a trip from New York (JFK) to Los Angeles on JetBlue. Every year, my family goes on a one-week pilgrimage, where we put our work on hold and spend time visiting temples, praying, and spending time with family and friends. To my Jewish friends, I often…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, I had to do the trick that is posted of pebble website to make my pebble notifications work.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://help.getpebble.com/customer/portal/articles/1092769-setting-up-notifications---ios&quot;&gt;http://help.getpebble.com/customer/portal/articles/1092769-setting-up-notifications&amp;#8212;-ios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;m not going to return my pebble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my pebble today and I used it for couple of hours. I must say, I&amp;#8217;m not impressed. It was pretty easy to start and connect it with my iPhone 4S. I took couple of minutes to setup and to find a right watch face. The watchface that is shown in the picture is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mypebblefaces.com/?query=91+weather#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;91 Weather Moonphase (iOS/ENU)&lt;/a&gt;. I will review this watchface at the end of this post. I will sort my findings to pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Music controls works flawless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answering and ignoring calls is good, but has some lag though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMS and iMessages arey displayed pretty decently and the navigation to read messages works fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide range of watchfaces available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did not find any issues with bluetooth connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No settings available to increase backlit time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No controls to toggle volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caller ID doesn&amp;#8217;t show the name of the caller (known issue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;#8217;t show Facebook, twitter and other notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be cool if there is another feature that shows the missed calls, voicemail and sms count. I found a watchface that shows weather data, but, It would be nice to have an option to see weather in pebble by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android users will love this. Most of the cons that I posted works perfectly with Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try this watch for few more days and will decide if I want to keep it or return it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mypebblefaces.com/?query=91+weather#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;91 Weather Moonphase (iOS/ENU) Watch Face:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pretty decent watch face that I found. Shows the current location weather. Limitations would be if I switch to another task and move back to this watch face, the weather detail disappears. The app that goes with this app needs to be opened in order to show that weather details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever, those very few employees of instagram are rich now. Hope Facebook doesn&amp;#8217;t ruin that app with its ads and other stuff.. I like this app the way it is now..&lt;/p&gt;

For this trick you don&amp;#8217;t have to create a whole new playlist and add one track to it. Your regular playlist will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) search for the track that you want to repeat in your playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Make sure only one song( that you want to repeat) is returned from your search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) play that song and select repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voila!! That track will be in repeat mode until you clear that text in the search box. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
