<p>So this is the third time that I&#8217;m going to gatlinburg,TN (smoky mountains). It has become like a tradition.. I hope I don&#8217;t go to this same place again next year..</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so used to that place, wake me up in the middle of the night and I can jot down a perfect plan.. No matter how long the trip will be..</p>
