<p>So I was playing around spotify today and found the other way of doing what Mohnish specified in his blog about <a href="http://blog.mohni.sh/post/18792634019/spotify-repeat-track"> repeating a track in spotify</a>. For this trick you don&#8217;t have to create a whole new playlist and add one track to it. Your regular playlist will do.</p>
<p>1) search for the track that you want to repeat in your playlist.</p>
<p>2) Make sure only one song( that you want to repeat) is returned from your search. </p>
<p>3) play that song and select repeat.</p>
<p>Voila!! That track will be in repeat mode until you clear that text in the search box. ;)</p>
